# Golden Data — How I Work

**Turning institutional chaos into decision-ready clarity.**

Golden Data exists to help teams make better decisions with data — not by adding more dashboards, but by building clear, repeatable analytics systems leaders can trust.

This repository documents **how I work**, not a product or a pitch.

---

## What I Optimize For

**Decisions first**  
Every engagement starts with a real business decision and the KPI(s) that inform it.

**Clarity over volume**  
If a dashboard doesn’t change behavior, it’s noise.

**Speed with quality**  
Conclusive answers, protected guardrails, and on-time delivery.

**Human-in-the-loop**  
I draft. Your team reviews. Nothing ships without alignment.

**Reproducibility**  
Every claim links back to data, queries, or code. Results can be rerun.

**Low drama**  
Clear scope, clear cadence, clear ownership.

## The Engagement Model

Most analytics failures happen *before* the first query is written.  
This is the flow I use to prevent that.

Decision → KPI → Guardrails → Data → Build → Review → Readout → Insight → Monitor


---

### 1. Define the Decision

- What choice is someone actually trying to make?
- Who owns it?
- What does success look like?

If the decision isn’t clear, we stop here.

---

### 2. Lock the Metrics

- Primary KPI (explicit definition)
- Secondary metrics (context, not distractions)
- Guardrails (what must not break)

No vague metrics. No retroactive redefinitions.

---

### 3. Validate Inputs

- Data sources identified
- Tracking verified
- Access confirmed
- Assumptions documented

If the data can’t support the decision, that’s surfaced early.

---

### 4. Build (Lean and Focused)

Depending on the problem:
- Dashboard
- Experiment analysis
- Metric framework
- One-off decision memo

The goal is **action**, not elegance.

---

### 5. Review Before Release

- Stakeholders review drafts
- Edge cases surfaced
- Interpretation aligned

This prevents surprises later.

---

### 6. Readout and Recommendation

Every readout includes:
- TL;DR decision
- What changed (absolute and relative)
- Confidence level and risks
- Clear recommendation

Not “here’s the data.”  
Here’s **what to do**.

---

### 7. Capture the Insight

Wins, losses, and inconclusive results are documented:
- What worked
- What didn’t
- When this applies again

This compounds value over time.

---

### 8. Monitor What Matters

If a metric drives decisions, it gets monitored.  
If it doesn’t, it gets retired.

---

## Communication Rhythm

- **Daily:** async updates (Slack or email)
- **Weekly:** priorities, risks, blockers
- **Friday update:**
  - What launched
  - What read out
  - What’s next

No black boxes. No bloated status decks.

---

## Typical Deliverables

- Decision briefs
- KPI definitions and governance docs
- Dashboards (Power BI, Looker, Tableau)
- Experiment charters and readouts
- Monitoring and guardrail plans
- Clear handoff documentation

---

## Who This Is For

- Product leaders tired of dashboard sprawl
- Executives who want answers, not charts
- Analytics teams that need structure without bureaucracy

If you’ve ever said *“we have the data, but…”* — this work is for you.

---

## What This Repo Is (and Isn’t)

**This is:**
- A public explanation of how I approach analytics work
- A signal of how engagements are run

**This is not:**
- A sales page
- A SaaS product
- A consulting funnel

---

## About

Golden Data is operated by **Paul Brown**, a senior analytics leader focused on building and stabilizing reporting, experimentation, and decision systems for high-growth teams.

### Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.  
Clarity beats completeness.
