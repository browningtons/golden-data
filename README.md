# Golden Data — How I Work

**Turning institutional chaos into decision-ready clarity.**

Golden Data exists to help teams make better decisions with data — not by adding more dashboards, but by building clear, repeatable analytics systems leaders can trust.

This repository documents **how I work**, not a product or a pitch.

## What I Optimize For

**Decisions first**  
Every engagement starts with a real business decision and the KPI(s) that inform it.

**Clarity over volume**  
If a dashboard doesn’t change behavior, it’s noise.

**Speed with quality**  
Conclusive answers, protected guardrails, and on-time delivery.

**Human-in-the-loop**  
I draft. Your team reviews. Nothing ships without alignment.

**Reproducibility**  
Every claim links back to data, queries, or code. Results can be rerun.

**Low drama**  
Clear scope, clear cadence, clear ownership.

## The Engagement Model

Most analytics failures happen *before* the first query is written.  
This is the flow I use to prevent that.
